title: Collaborative Filtering Ensemble
abstract: This paper provides the solution of the team “commendo” on the Track1 dataset
  of the KDD Cup 2011 Dror etÂ al.. Yahoo Labs provides a snapshot of their music-rating
  database as dataset for the competition. We get approximately 260 million ratings
  from 1 million users on 600k items. Timestamp and taxonomy information are added
  to the ratings. The goal of the competition was to predict unknown ratings on a
  testset with RMSE as error measure. Our final submission is a blend of different
  collaborative filtering algorithms. The algorithms are trained consecutively and
  they are blended together with a neural network.
