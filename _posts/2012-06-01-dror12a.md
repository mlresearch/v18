title: The Yahoo! Music Dataset and KDD-Cup’11
abstract: 'KDD-Cup 2011 challenged the community to identify user tastes in music
  by leveraging Yahoo! Music user ratings. The competition hosted two tracks, which
  were based on two datasets sampled from the raw data, including hundreds of millions
  of ratings. The underlying ratings were given to four types of musical items: tracks,
  albums, artists, and genres, forming a four level hierarchical taxonomy. The challenge
  started on March 15, 2011 and ended on June 30, 2011 attracting 2389 participants,
  2100 of which were active by the end of the competition. The popularity of the challenge
  is related to the fact that learning a large scale recommender systems is a generic
  problem, highly relevant to the industry. In addition, the contest drew interest
  by introducing a number of scientific and technical challenges including dataset
  size, hierarchical structure of items, high resolution timestamps of ratings, and
  a non-conventional ranking-based task. This paper provides the organizers’ account
  of the contest, including: a detailed analysis of the datasets, discussion of the
  contest goals and actual conduct, and lessons learned throughout the contest.'
